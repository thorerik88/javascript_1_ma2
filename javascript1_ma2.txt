//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
A function literal is an expression that defines an unnamed function.
A function literal syntax is like a function statement, except it is used as an expression instead of a statement and a function name, is not required.

2. What is the constructor?
A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object, within a class.
example:
class Car {
 constructor(name, color, hp) {
 	this.name = name;
	this.color = color;
	this.hp = hp;
 }
}

const car1 = new Car("Ferrari", "Red", 450);


3. What does the return statement do?
The return statement stops a function execution and returns a value from the function.
You can also create a function after the return statement, within the original function block.


4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();
inside my function
undefined
you can't add an action together with the return statement.

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
A function is a global object, that can be accessed globally(called from anywhere in the script).
a variable within the block of that function, can not be accessed outside the function, because it's a local scope.
Example:

function myCar() { <----- global scope
	var car = 'Fiat'; <----- local scope
}
